# X-Ray-Image-Processing-Pneumonia-Prediction-Model

-Pneumonia is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide. Pneumonia killed 740,180 children under the age of 5 in 2019, accounting for 14% of all deaths of children under five years old but 22% of all deaths in children aged 1 to 5. It is a major cause of death among all other age groups as well apart from childrens, resulting in 1.4 million deaths in 2010 (7% of the world's yearly total) and 3.0 million deaths in 2016 (the 4th leading cause of death in the world).

-Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.

-The Model recognizes the X-Ray Image and categorize/predict into a Normal Condition X-Ray Image or a Potential Pneumonia Condition X-Ray Image to reduce the spreading of infamous Pneumonia disease, especially in the times of COVID-19. All chest X-ray imaging during data gathering was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care. For the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans by Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou.
